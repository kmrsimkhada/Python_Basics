#Creating a list

'''
The exercise in the 9th chapter focuses on one of the most powerful tools in the Python language, 
the datatype list, and the first assignment is a simple exercise to create. 
Define a list which has four items, strings "Blue","Red","Yellow" and "Green". 
After this, make a slice from the list which contains only the first item of the list (list place 0), 
and print out all of the items with one for-structure. When the code works properly, 
the program prints the following:
			
>>> 
The first item in the list is: Blue
The entire list printed one item a time:
Blue
Red
Yellow
Green
>>> 
'''

lists = ["Blue", "Red", "Yellow", "Green"]

print("The first item in the list is:",lists[0])
print("The entire list printed one item a time:")
for i in lists:
	print(i)
