#Basic exception handler

'''
The first exercise in this chapter discusses the most common problem with programs in Python: 
getting a numeric value as input without a problem or constant fear of TypeError. 
Simply put, create a program, which asks the user for input and tries to convert it to an integer value.
 If the conversion happens without problems, the program prints "The input was suitable!". If the user gives something which does not convert, 
 like letters or special characters, the program avoids the error with an exception handler and prints "The input was malformed.". 
 When working correctly, the program prints out the following:

			
Give a number: Monkeys?
The input was malformed.

or alternatively
			
Give a number: 234
The input was suitable!

Probably the best way of implementing this exercise is to use the generic error class Exception, as there are some special cases where the interpreter actually raises something else than TypeError, like ValueError or NameError. 
Also keep in mind, that there can be an else-segement in the exception handler.


'''
number = input("Give a number: ")

try:
	number = int(number)
	print("The input was suitable!")

except Exception:
	print("The input was malformed.")
