#Your own module with several parameters

'''
The fourth exercise in this module elaborates on the idea applied in the last exercise. 
In the exercise the idea is once again to create a module for an existing main program. 
The module tests the feasibility of different user-given inputs for a password. 
The existing code which uses the module is as follows:

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

import inspector
while True:
    userinput = input("Give a string for testing: ")
    tulos = inspector.testme(userinput)
    if tulos == True:
        print("This string fits for a password!")
        break
    else:
        print("The module says no.")

The idea is to create the module inspector and the function testme which receives the user-given candidate for a password. 
If the given input is shorter than 6 characters, contains only letters or only numbers, the module should reject the candidate and return False. 
If the input is longer than 6 characters and has both numbers and letters, it should be accepted. 
In this case the module should return True. When the program works correctly, it prints the following:
			
>>> 
Give a string for testing: Test
The module says no.
Give a string for testing: 234234
The module says no.
Give a string for testing: Youhavetobekiddingme1234
This string fits for a password!
>>>

def testme(password):
	if len(password) > 6 and str.isalnum(password) and (not str.isdigit(password)) and (not str.isalpha(password)):
		return True
	else:
		return False
