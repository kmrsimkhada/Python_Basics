Traditionally the first program in any programming course is the one where the system is made to print the words "Hello World!", in one variation or another. 
So unsurprisingly the first programming exercise in this course does exactly that. 
In the last pages of the chapter there were detailed instructions on how to test the interpreter installation and make the first program, which printed some text. 
In this exercise, the aim is to replicate that example.

So in short, by following the instructions from the chapter, make a program which prints the following text:

Hello World!
This here is a Python program.
'''

print("Hello World!")
print("This here is a Python program.")
